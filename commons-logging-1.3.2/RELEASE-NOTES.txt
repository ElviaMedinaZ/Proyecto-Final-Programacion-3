Apache Commons Logging Package 1.1.1 Release Notes
--------------------------------------------------

This release of Apache Commons Logging is a maintenance release, with just a
couple of fixes for using Commons Logging under restrictive security policies.

All core classes were compiled with Maven using a 1.4.x JDK, with target set
to 1.1 and source set to 1.2. Commons Logging may work on some
augmented 1.1 series JREs but it is recommended that those wish to run
on 1.1 JREs download the source and create a custom implementation by
stripping out all the complex classloader management code.

For further details, please see the Apache Commons Logging website:
  http://commons.apache.org/logging/

For the very latest news, hints, FAQs etc. please see the
Apache Commons Logging wiki site:
  http://wiki.apache.org/commons/Logging

Note that some containers (some versions of Apache Tomcat and JBoss in
particular) prevent webapps, ejbs, etc from overriding the commons-logging
implementation provided by the container. This means that bundling this
updated implementation with a deployed application may not have any effect.
See the commons-logging site and/or the wiki for more information.

New Features Since 1.1.0
------------------------

None.

Incompatibilities
-----------------

The protected method LogFactory.getContextClassLoader has been reverted to pre-1.1
behaviour. In earlier releases, this method did not use an AccessController when
obtaining the context classloader. In version 1.1 it did. In this release, it has
reverted to not using an AccessController; any user-level code that needs to obtain
a context classloader should itself create an AccessController, and call the
LogFactory.getContextClassLoader method via the doPrivileged method. This fixes a
potential security issue, where untrusted code could get access to the context
classloader if a signed Commons Logging library was in the classpath.

Dependencies
------------

Commons Logging has no mandatory dependencies.

Java 1.2 and later are supported. It may be possible to use this release with
java 1.1 but this has not been tested; the unit tests certainly don't run on
that version.

Distributed Jar Files
---------------------

File commons-logging-nn.jar is the one most people will want. It provides the
base implementation and adapters to a number of popular logging libraries.

File commons-logging-adapters-nn.jar includes only the adapters to various
concrete logging libraries. When commons-logging-nn.jar or
commons-logging-api-nn.jar is deployed in a container classpath, then this
adapters-only jar file should be deployed in the webapp, not the complete Commons
Logging distribution. This ensures that the core Log/LogFactory classes are only
deployed via one classloader, thus avoiding "Log4JLogger does not implement Log"
and similar problems.

File commons-logging-api-nn.jar provides minimal adapters to external logging
libraries, just the internally implemented SimpleLog and NoOpLog classes
plus Jdk14Logger (which is currently required by Apache Tomcat).

The file commons-logging-api-nn.jar may be used as a declared dependency for
projects that care about "transitive dependencies" and can't handle jar files
such as commons-logging-nn.jar which have "optional" dependencies depending on
how they are used. In addition, this jar file can be useful for "rebundlers" of
Commons Logging who recompile the source-code but who may not be able to
recompile against the full set of supported adapters; such projects should be
able to at least recreate an equivalent of this jar file.

General Notes
-------------

The Apache Commons project has migrated to the Subversion version control system
(previously, CVS was used). There should be no effect on users of the Commons
Logging library, but obviously the process of examining the latest source code,
and of creating patches for Commons Logging has now changed. Please see the
Apache Commons website for details (http://commons.apache.org/).

The Apache Commons project has now moved to using the Apache JIRA installation
as its bugtracking system (formerly, the Apache Bugzilla installation was used).

All source files for this release have been updated to reflect the new Apache
Software Foundation licensing rules. The terms and conditions are unaltered;
this merely affects how those are presented in the source files. See
  http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html

This release can be built/tested with Maven 2.0.x as well as Ant. Note that
building with Maven 1.x is no longer supported. The files used to build Commons
Logging with Maven 1.x will be removed in a future version of Commons Logging.

Bugs Fixed
----------

* LOGGING-106: Commons Logging 1.1 was completely unusable under a security
  policy that prevented access to system properties. Even signing/authorising
  the Commons Logging library was not sufficient. This has been fixed by (a)
  catching SecurityException and falling back to a sensible default, and (b)
  using AccessController so Commons Logging can be granted privileges without
  needing the caller to have them too.

* LOGGING-107: Commons Logging 1.1 auto-discovery failed under a security
  policy that prevented calls to ClassLoader.getParent. Signing/authorising the
  Commons Logging library was not sufficient as an AccessController was not used.
  This has been fixed by catching SecurityException and using an AccessController.

* LOGGING-111, LOGGING-114: Show the contents of chained exceptions, to make
  debugging easier, in particular when using Commons Logging together with Log4J.

* LOGGING-113: pom.xml in maven repository does not list dependencies as optional.

* LOGGING-115: NPE thrown due to exception message logging.

* LOGGING-117: Unit tests fail on linux with java16.

* LOGGING-118: Generate source and binary archives.

* MEV-392 (http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MEV-392)
  As Commons Logging didn't provide a Maven2 pom.xml file, one was helpfully
  created by people not involved with the commons-logging project and published
  to the standard maven repositories. Unfortunately this pom declared normal
  dependencies on all the logging libraries that are supported by the core
  Commons Logging distribution, meaning they all get pulled into a project that
  declares a dependency on Commons Logging 1.1. This release now provides an
  "official" pom.xml which declares these dependencies as optional so they aren't
  automatically included in projects that depend on Commons Logging 1.1.1.

* (no bug#): Fix thread-safety bug (SimpleDateFormat.format is not thread-safe).
  Thanks to Martin Wilson of bright-interactive for the bug report.

* (no bug#): Security issue regarding access to context classloader (see
  incompatibilities section above).

DEPRECATIONS
------------

    (These are carried forward from Version 1.0.4)

[LogSource]        Previously deprecated, replaced by LogFactory.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apache Commons Logging 1.0.4 Release Notes
------------------------------------------

This document contains the release notes for this version of the Commons
Logging package.  It is primarily a service release for downstream users.
The main emphasis maintenance and code cleanup release,
with some new features including support for both the old 1.2.x series
of Log4J releases and the new 1.3.x series of releases.

The following paragraphs document changes since the previous release
(version 1.0.3). The documentation (userguide and javadoc) 
has also been improved.

New Features
------------

[ALL FILES]        This version of Commons Logging is released under the
                   Apache License (Version 2.0).  All source files have been
                   modified to reflect this.

[maven.xml]        Added beginnings of a Maven-based build, primarily for the
                   purpose of creating documentation consistent with Mavenized
                   commons projects.  The official build system for the software
                   is still the Ant "build.xml" file.

[AvalonLogger]     Added AvalonLogger, which wraps the logger used by the
                   Avalon framework.  As with other implementations, this
                   is compiled only if the appropriate dependencies are
                   satisfied.

[Jdk13LumberjackLogger]
                   Added Jdk13LumberjackLogger, which wraps the implementation
                   of the JSR-47 logging APIs (for JDKs before 1.4) provided
                   by the SourceForge "lumberjack" project.
                   <http://sourceforge.net/projects/lumberjack/>

[LogFactoryImpl]   If an InvocationTargetException is returned during the
                   creation of a new Log instance, unwrap the underlying
                   cause and pass it in to the LogConfigurationException
                   constructor.  This will make the actual cause of the
                   problem easier to diagnose.

[LogFactoryImpl]   If the isAssignableFrom() test fails because there is more
                   than one instance of org.apache.commons.logging.Log visible
                   in the class loader hierarchy, make the exception message
                   that is reported explicitly state this, rather than the
                   potentially misleading claim that an implementation class
                   does not implement Log.

[Log4JLogger]      Changes to allow this logger to support both the existing 1.2.x 
                   series of releases and also the upcoming 1.3.x series of Log4J
                   releases.

[SimpleLog]        Added support for setting date-time format.

Bug Fixes
---------

[MANIFEST.MF]      Remove reference to Log4J from the manifest classpath.

[LogConfigurationException]
                   Include root cause in the text of the message, if present.

[LogFactory]       Improve usability of error messages reporting
                   configuration problems.

[JDK14Logger]      Implement Serializable, remove "final" declaration for
                   easy subclassing.

[Log4JLogger]      Implement Serializable, remove "final" declaration for
                   easy subclassing.

[NoOpLogger]       Implement Serializable, remove "final" declaration for
                   easy subclassing.

[SimpleLog]        Make SimpleLog more friendly to the security manager
                   in an applet environment, by swallowing any security
                   exceptions when looking up system properties that are
                   not accessible.

Deprecations
------------

    (These are carried forward from Version 1.0.3)

[LogSource]        Previously deprecated, replaced by LogFactory.

[Log4jFactory]     A proxy instance of this class was transparently created
                   when Log4J logging was selected, yet it serves no useful
                   purpose.  The class is now deprecated, and the proxy
                   instance is no longer created.

[Log4JCategoryLog] This class has been replaced by Log4JLogger, which
                   corresponds to the availability of the new Logger class
                   in Log4J 1.2 and later.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apache Commons Logging 1.0.3 Release Notes
------------------------------------------

This document contains the release notes for this version of the Commons
Logging package.  It is primarily a maintenance and code cleanup release,
with minimal new features.

The following paragraphs document changes since the previous release
(version 1.0.2).

New Features
------------

[build.xml]        Refined build process to correctly avoid compiling classes
                   when dependencies are not available, and to avoid name
                   clashes over Ant properties used in different ways.

[unit tests]       Added new suites of tests for the Log4J and JDK 1.4
                   logging implementations, including tests with multiple
                   class loaders that closely simulate the scenario of using
                   commons-logging in a servlet container.

[documentation]    Overall cleanup and correction of the JavaDoc documentation
                   to correctly reflect the current behavior.  In particular,
                   the default logging implementation (selected if nothing
                   else is configured) is now SimpleLog, not NoOpLog.

[LogFactory]       Add a static release(ClassLoader) method that allows,
                   for example, a webapp to clean up all c-l references
                   prior to being shut down.

Bug Fixes
---------

[build.xml]        Correct the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF that was embedded in the
                   generated JAR files to properly contain the version number.

[LogFactory]       Fix security violations on several ClassLoader method
                   invocations.

[SimpleLog]        Dump stack trace through logger, instead of directly to
                   System.out, to preserve output sequence.

[SimpleLog]        Avoid a security exception if system properties cannot be
                   read (such as in an applet).

[Bugzilla 10825]   NullPointerException when Logger.getClassLoader()
                   returns null.

[Bugzilla 13118]   Correct detection of JDK 1.4 that was mis-identifying on a
                   scenario where a JDK 1.3 implementation included an
                   implementation of JSR-47 logging.

[Bugzilla 13157]   Incorrect selection of Log4J in a servlet container.

[Bugzilla 13201]   Log4JLogger should not attempt to auto-configure
                   appenders; this is out of scope for commons-logging.

[Bugzilla 17561]   Attempts to override Log4J configuration.

[Bugzilla 17894]   Unable to configure commons-logging SimpleLog for a webapp.

[Bugzilla 18184]   Jdk14Logger should not waste the effort to create a
                   Throwable (to extract calling class and method) if the
                   message is not going to be logged anyway.


Deprecations
------------

[LogSource]        Previously deprecated, replaced by LogFactory.

[Log4jFactory]     A proxy instance of this class was transparently created
                   when Log4J logging was selected, yet it serves no useful
                   purpose.  The class is now deprecated, and the proxy
                   instance is no longer created.

[Log4JCategoryLog] This class has been replaced by Log4JLogger, which
                   corresponds to the availability of the new Logger class
                   in Log4J 1.2 and later.

Apache Commons Logging Package 1.0 Release Notes
------------------------------------------------

This document contains the release notes for this version of the Commons
Logging package. This is the first release of commons-logging.

New Features
------------

* commons-logging implements an abstraction between logging and the logging 
  implementation being used.  You can currently use Avalon's logkit, Log4J, 
  JDK 1.4's logging, or nothing at all.  It is up to you.
